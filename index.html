      <blockquote>
        Barcodes are a type of optical machine-readable representation of data,
        which are used to store information about a product or item. They are
        typically printed on labels or tags and are scanned by a barcode reader.
        Barcodes are composed of a series of vertical lines of varying widths
        and spaces, which represent numbers and letters. The information encoded
        in the barcode is determined by the widths and spaces of the lines. The
        most common type of barcode is the Universal Product Code (UPC), which
        is used to identify products in stores. UPC barcodes are composed of 12
        digits, which are divided into two parts. The first six digits are the
        manufacturer's code, while the last six digits are the product's code.
        The barcode also contains a check digit, which is used to verify the
        accuracy of the code.
